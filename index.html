      <p>Do you have a box of old videotapes filled with priceless memories—but no way to play them anymore? Every year, those tapes degrade a little more, risking permanent loss of irreplaceable moments with family and friends. Don't wait until it's too late. I’ll carefully convert your VHS, Hi8, MiniDV, and other formats to high-quality digital MP4 files so you can watch, share, and preserve them for generations.</p>
      <p>I include premium services like <strong>color correction</strong> and <strong>audio cleanup</strong> for no extra charge. I offer <strong>better quality and lower prices</strong> than big-box services like Legacybox, iMemories, Walmart, or Costco—with personal service and local pickup.</p>
      <div style="background-color:#222;padding:1rem;border-left:6px solid #ffcc66;margin-top:1rem;">
        <strong>✅ Included in Every Transfer:</strong><br>
        🎨 <strong>Color Correction:</strong> Brightens and balances faded footage<br>
        🔊 <strong>Audio Cleanup:</strong> Reduces hiss, hum, and harsh spikes<br>
        ✂️ <strong>Trimming & Cropping:</strong> Eliminates dead space and edge distortion from worn or damaged tapes<br>
        🏷️ <strong>File Naming:</strong> Each file is named to match the label on the tape
